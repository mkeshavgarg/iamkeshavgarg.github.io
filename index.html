        <h2>The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets</h2>
        <h5>Published October 8, 2003</h5>
        <!-- <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div> -->
        <p>Unicode was a brave effort to create a single character set that included every reasonable writing system on the planet and some make-believe ones like Klingon, too. Some people are under the misconception that Unicode is simply a 16-bit code where each character takes 16 bits and therefore there are 65,536 possible characters</p>

      <p>Are you loading your database up with work it doesn't really need to be doing? Are you counting things and storing them in their own collections? Are you spending time working out if something was unique just to count the number of unique things you've seen in your data?</p>

        <h2>Garbage collection in Python: things you need to know</h2>
        <h5>Published April 05, 2018</h5>
        <!-- <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div> -->
        <p>Unlike many other languages, Python does not necessarily release the memory back to the Operating System. Instead, it has a specialized object allocator for small objects (smaller or equal to 512 bytes), which keeps some chunks of already allocated memory for further use in future. The amount of memory that Python holds depending on the usage patterns, in some cases all allocated memory is never released.</p>

        <h2>MongoDB - Replication and Sharding Tutorial</h2>
        <h5>Published August 11, 2017</h5>
        <!-- <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div> -->
        <p>The primary task of a MongoDB administrator is to set up replication and ensure that it is functioning correctly. The replication functionality is recommended for use in the production setting. Replication in MongoDB increases data availability by creating data redundancy. MongoDB replication stores multiple copies of data across different databases in multiple locations, and thus protects data when the database suffers any loss.</p>

        <h2>Client-side vs. server-side rendering: why it’s not all black and white</h2>

        <!-- <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div> -->
        <p>Server-side rendering is the most common method for displaying information onto the screen. It works by converting HTML files in the server into usable information for the browser.</p>

          <!-- /<div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div> -->
          <p>Seldom can one database fit the needs of multiple distinct use cases. The days of the one-size-fits-all monolithic database are behind us, and developers are now building highly distributed applications using a multitude of purpose-built databases. Developers are doing what they do best: breaking complex applications into smaller pieces and then picking the best tool to solve each problem. The best tool for a job usually differs by use case.</p>
